# How to make a new release (maintainer info)

## Release schedule

The xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC release schedule generally follows the
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
release schedule, which is about two releases per year.

## Prepare the build

Before starting the build, perform some checks and tweaks.

### Check Git

- switch to the `xpack-develop` branch
- if needed, merge the `xpack` branch

### Update to latest Arm release

- download the new _Source Invariant_ archive from
  [Arm](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
- clone the `arm-gcc-original-scripts.git` repo
- remove all files except README.md, from the repo
- copy/paste all files, except the PDF, from the new archive
- commit with a message like **10-2020-q4-major**; also add a tag;
- check differences from the previous version;
- determine the GCC version (like `10.2.1`) and update the `scripts/VERSION`
  file; the format is `10.2.1-1.1`;
- add a new set of definitions in the `scripts/common-versions-source.sh`,
  with the versions of various components;
- if newer libraries are used, check if they are available from the local git
  cache project.

### Increase the version

Determine the GCC version (like `10.2.1`) and update the `scripts/VERSION`
file; the format is `10.2.1-1.1`. The fourth number is the xPack release number
of this version. A fifth number will be added when publishing
the package on the `npm` server.

### Fix possible open issues

Check GitHub issues and pull requests:

- https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues

and fix them; assign them to a milestone (like `10.2.1-1.1`).

### Check `README.md`

Normally `README.md` should not need changes, but better check.
Information related to the new version should not be included here,
but in the version specific file (below).

## Update `CHANGELOG.md`

- open the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- check if all previous fixed issues are in
- add a new entry like _v10.2.1-1.1 prepared_
- commit commit with a message like _CHANGELOG: prepare v10.2.1-1.1_

Note: if you missed to update the `CHANGELOG.md` before starting the build,
edit the file and rerun the build, it should take only a few minutes to
recreate the archives with the correct file.

### Update the version specific code

- open the `common-versions-source.sh` file
- add a new `if` with the new version before the existing code

### Update helper

With Sourcetree, go to the helper repo and update to the latest master commit.

## Build

### Development run the build scripts

Before the real build, run a test build on the development machine (`wks`):

```bash
sudo rm -rf ~/Work/arm-none-eabi-gcc-*

caffeinate bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --develop --without-pdf --disable-tests --disable-multilib --linux64 --win64 --linux32 --win32
```

Work on the scripts until all 4 platforms pass the build.

Possibly add binutils & gdb patches.

## Push the build script

In this Git repo:

- push the `xpack-develop` branch to GitHub
- possibly push the helper project too

From here it'll be cloned on the production machines.

### Run the build scripts without multilibs

Move to the three production machines.

On the macOS build machine (`xbbm`):

- empty the trash bin
- create three new terminals

Connect to the Intel Linux (`xbbi`):

```bash
caffeinate ssh xbbi
```

Connect to the Arm Linux (`xbba`):

```bash
caffeinate ssh xbba
```

On all machines, clone the `xpack-develop` branch:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git; \
git clone \
  --recurse-submodules \
  --branch xpack-develop \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git \
  ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
```

On all machines, remove any previous build:

```bash
sudo rm -rf ~/Work/arm-none-eabi-gcc-*
```

On the macOS machine (`xbbm`):

```bash
caffeinate bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --osx --disable-multilib
```

A typical run takes about 85 minutes.

On `xbbi`:

```bash
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --linux64 --win64 --disable-multilib
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --linux32 --win32 --disable-multilib
```

A typical run takes about 110 minutes.

On `xbba`:

```bash
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --arm64 --disable-multilib
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --arm32 --disable-multilib
```

A typical run takes about 390 minutes.

### Clean the destination folder for the test binaries

On the development machine (`wks`) clear the folder where binaries from all
build machines will be collected.

```bash
rm -f ~/Downloads/xpack-binaries/arm-none-eabi-gcc/*
```

Note: this step is very important, to avoid using test binaries!

### Copy the test binaries to the development machine

On all three machines:

```console
(cd ~/Work/arm-none-eabi-gcc-*/deploy; scp * ilg@wks:Downloads/xpack-binaries/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
```

## Publish the binaries as pre-release/experimental

For really new versions, test before making the release.

Use the [experimental pre-release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/tag/experimental)
to publish the binaries, to run the Travis tests and to allow for
others to test them.

## Run the pre-release Travis tests

In the `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-*.sh` files, check and update the
URL to use something like

```
base_url="https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/pre-releases/releases/download/experimental/"
```

Trigger the stable and latest Travis builds (on a Mac by double-clicking
on the command scripts):

- `trigger-travis-quick.mac.command` (optional)
- `trigger-travis-stable.mac.command`
- `trigger-travis-latest.mac.command`

The test results are available from:

- https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack

### Run the build scripts with multilibs

On all machines, clone the `xpack-develop` branch:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git; \
git clone \
  --recurse-submodules \
  --branch xpack-develop \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git \
  ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
```

On all machines, remove any previous build:

```bash
sudo rm -rf ~/Work/arm-none-eabi-gcc-*
```

Empty trash.

On the macOS machine (`xbbm`):

```bash
caffeinate bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --osx
```

A typical run takes about 230 minutes.

On `xbbi`:

```bash
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --linux64 --win64
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --linux32 --win32
```

A typical run takes about 310 minutes.

On `xbba`:

```bash
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --arm64
bash ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git/scripts/build.sh --arm32
```

A typical run takes about 930 minutes.

### Clean the destination folder

On the development machine (`wks`) clear the folder where binaries from all
build machines will be collected.

```bash
rm -f ~/Downloads/xpack-binaries/arm-none-eabi-gcc/*
```

### Copy the binaries to the development machine

On all three machines:

```console
(cd ~/Work/arm-none-eabi-gcc-*/deploy; scp * ilg@wks:Downloads/xpack-binaries/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
```

## Testing

Install the binaries on all supported platforms and check if they are
functional.

For this, on each platform (Mac, GNU/Linux 64/32, Windows 64/32):

- unpack the archive in `Desktop` or in `Downloads`, and rename the version
  folder, by replacing a dash with a space; this will test paths with spaces;
  on Windows the current paths always use spaces, so renaming is not needed;
- clone this repo locally; on Windows use the Git console;

```bash
git clone \
  --recurse-submodules \
  --branch xpack-develop \
  https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git \
  ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
```

- in a separate workspace, Import → General → Existing Projects into Workspace
  the Eclipse projects available in the
  `tests/eclipse` folder of the build repo; more details in the
  [README.md](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/tests/eclipse/README.md)
- define the **Workspace Arm Toolchain path** to use the `Downloads`
  temporary location
- to test the compiler: for all projects (start with `arm-f4b-fs-lib`)
  - remove all build folders, or **Clean all**
  - build all configs, with the hammer, not with **Build all**, to be sure
    errors are not missed
- to test the debugger: for all QEMU debug configurations (start with
  `arm-f4b-fs-debug-lto-qemu`)
  - start the QEMU debug session,
  - single step a few lines (Step Over)
  - start continuous run (Resume)
  - halt (Suspend)
  - start (Resume)
  - stop (Terminate)
  - (don't miss the LTO cases, since in the past they had problems)
- to test the Python debugger, start it with `--version`

## Create a new GitHub pre-release

- in `CHANGELOG.md`, add release date
- commit and push the `xpack-develop` branch
- go to the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases) page
- click **Draft a new release**, in the `xpack-develop` branch
- name the tag like **v10.2.1-1.1** (mind the dash in the middle!)
- name the release like **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC v10.2.1-1.1**
(mind the dash)
- as description
  - add a downloads badge like `![Github Releases (by Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/v10.2.1-1.1/total.svg)`
  - draft a short paragraph explaining what are the main changes
  - add _For the moment these binaries are provided only for testing purposes!_
- **attach binaries** and SHA (drag and drop from the archives folder will do it)
- **enable** the **pre-release** button
- click the **Publish Release** button

Note: at this moment the system should send a notification to all clients
watching this project.

## Run the release Travis tests

Using the scripts in `tests/scripts/`, start:

- `trigger-travis-quick.mac.command` (optional)
- `trigger-travis-stable.mac.command`
- `trigger-travis-latest.mac.command`

The test results are available from:

- https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack

For more details, see `tests/scripts/README.md`.

## Prepare a new blog post

In the `xpack/web-jekyll` GitHub repo:

- select the `develop` branch
- add a new file to `_posts/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases`
- name the file like `2020-12-19-arm-none-eabi-gcc-v10-2-1-1-1-released.md`
- name the post like: **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC v10.2.1-1.1 released**
- as `download_url` use the tagged URL like `https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/tag/v10.2.1-1.1/`
- update the `date:` field with the current date
- update the Travis URLs using the actual test pages
- update the SHA sums via copy/paste from the original build machines
(it is very important to use the originals!)

If any, refer to closed
[issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/issues)
as:

- **[Issue:\[#1\]\(...\)]**.

### Update the SHA sums

Copy/paste the build report at the end of the post as:

```console

## Check the SHA sums

On the development machine (`wks`):

```bash
cd ~Downloads/xpack-binaries/arm-none-eabi-gcc
cat *.sha
```

## Update the preview Web

- commit the `develop` branch of `xpack/web-jekyll` GitHub repo; use a message
  like **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC v10.2.1-1.1 released**
- wait for the GitHub Pages build to complete
- the preview web is https://xpack.github.io/web-preview/

## Update package.json binaries

- select the `xpack-develop` branch
- open the `package.json` file
- run `xpm-dev binaries-update`

```
cd ~/Downloads/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
xpm-js.git/bin/xpm-dev.js binaries-update '10.2.1-1.1' "${HOME}/Downloads/xpack-binaries/arm-none-eabi-gcc"
```

- open the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases)
  page and select the latest release
- check the download counter, it should match the number of tests
- check the `baseUrl:` it should match the file URLs (including the tag/version);
  no terminating `/` is required
- from the release, check the SHA & file names
- compare the SHA sums with those shown by `cat *.sha`
- check the executable names
- commit all changes, use a message like
  `package.json: update urls for 10.2.1-1.1 release` (without `v`)

## Publish on the npmjs.com server

- select the `xpack-develop` branch
- check the latest commits `npm run git-log`
- update `CHANGELOG.md`; commit with a message like
  _CHANGELOG: prepare npm v10.2.1-1.1.2_
- `npm version 10.2.1-1.1.2`; the first 5 numbers are the same as the
  GitHub release; the sixth number is the npm specific version
- `npm pack` and check the content of the archive, which should list
  only the `package.json`, the `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- push the `xpack-develop` branch to GitHub
- `npm publish --tag next` (use `--access public` when publishing for
  the first time)

The version is visible at:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc?activeTab=versions

## Test if the npm binaries can be installed with xpm

Run the `tests/scripts/trigger-travis-xpm-install.sh` script, this
will install the package on Intel Linux 64-bit, macOS and Windows 64-bit.

The test results are available from:

- https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack

For 32-bit Windows, 32-bit Intel GNU/Linux and 32-bit Arm, install manually.

```bash
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@next
```

## Test the npm binaries
